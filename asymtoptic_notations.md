## Theta notation(Θ notation)
- Θ(g(n)) = {f(n): there exist positive constants c1, c2 and n0 such that 0 ≤ c1g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c2g(n) for all n ≥ n0}
- Gives the average case scenario of an algorithm 

##  Big O notation
- O(g(n)) = { f(n): there exist positive constants c and n0 such that 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ cg(n) for all n ≥ n0 }
- Gives the worst case scenario of an algorithm

## Omega notation(Ω-Notation)
- Ω(g(n)) = { f(n): there exist positive constants c and n0 such that 0 ≤ cg(n) ≤ f(n) for all n ≥ n0 }
- Gives the best case scenario of an algorithm
